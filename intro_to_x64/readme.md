RSI: Source Index register (used for string/memory operations).
RDI: Destination Index register (used for string/memory operations).
RBX: Base register (often used as a base pointer in data structures).
RBP: Base Pointer register (used to point to the base of the current stack frame).
R12 – R15: Additional 8 general-purpose registers introduced in 64-bit mode, used for general computations and addressing.
