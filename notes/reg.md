In x86-64 architecture, there are 16 general-purpose registers that are 64 bits wide. These registers are:

1. **RAX** – Accumulator
2. **RBX** – Base
3. **RCX** – Counter
4. **RDX** – Data
5. **RSI** – Source Index
6. **RDI** – Destination Index
7. **RBP** – Base Pointer
8. **RSP** – Stack Pointer
9. **R8** – General-purpose register
10. **R9** – General-purpose register
11. **R10** – General-purpose register
12. **R11** – General-purpose register
13. **R12** – General-purpose register
14. **R13** – General-purpose register
15. **R14** – General-purpose register
16. **R15** – General-purpose register

In addition to these, there are also specialized registers like the instruction pointer (RIP), flags register (RFLAGS), and segment registers.
