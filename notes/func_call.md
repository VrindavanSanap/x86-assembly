 * Registers on entry:
 * rax  system call number
 * rcx  return address
 * r11  saved rflags (note: r11 is callee-clobbered register in C ABI)
 * rdi  arg0
 * rsi  arg1
 * rdx  arg2
 * r10  arg3 (needs to be moved to rcx to conform to C ABI)
 * r8   arg4
 * r9   arg5
 * (note: r12-r15, rbp, rbx are callee-preserved in C ABI)
 *
 
For example 
Write syscall function takes in 3 arguments 
therefore 
rdi = fd
rsi = buf
rdx = nbyte
ssize_t write(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
